# Solarcast
Safecast Solarcast sensor device is designed to operate off-grid and sense environmental parameters. It consists of 5 key modules designed for maximal reuse.

## Modular design
 1. [Air sensor module](/air-module)
 2. [Geiger sensor module](/geiger-module)
 3. [Battery power module](/battery-module)
 4. [Communications module](/communications-module)
 5. [Gateway module](/gateway-module)

In an optimal design all modules have their own BLE processor and can be directly combined between each other, initial design is however only partially modular.
